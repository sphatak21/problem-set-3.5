<h3 style="color: lightblue">Quarterbacks</h3>

  <p id="txt">The quarterback is arguably the most important position on the football
  and on your fantasy football team. He, generally, scores the most points
  and has the biggest impact on the game. It is not a stretch to equate the
  quality of your quarterback to the quality of your team: a better quarterback
  means a better team. In standard 10 team leagues, draft at most two
  quarterbacks, especially if the second one has a good matchup during your
  starting quarterback’s bye week. Drafting more than two is a waste of
  valuable roster space: drafting one is risky but a waiver wire pick up
  can still be sufficient for a bye week fill in.

<h3 style="color:lightgreen">Running Backs</h3>

    <p id="txt">In standard 10 team leagues, there are two running back positions, with an
    option of flexing one (we will revisit the flex position later). It is
    essential to grab a running back early in your draft in general, as the
    running back position is not very deep most years. Think about it like
    this: in 32 NFL teams, only about 20 have good offenses, and only 15-20
    have running backs that are starter caliber, and out of them anywhere from
    between 3-5 will go in the first round. This does not even account for the
     possibility that a running back may be a “bust” or, due to the physicality
      of the position, become injured. The first and second round itself
      depletes the draft of many high quality running backs. It is important
      in a standard draft to take at least 3 running backs, or four if there
      is a sleeper available.</p>
<h3 style="color:yellow">Wide Receivers</h3>
<img src = "https://encrypted-tbn0.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:ANd9GcTtQfaXApf18y6mMNtSazRIPPBmJRXHQpjobjQQP1ZMnTMQ_ykVHg"/>
    <p id="txt">
      In standard 10 team leagues, the wide receiver is the position where the
      most gambling occurs. Traditionally, the receiver gets .1 points per
      receiving yard, and in points-per-reception play, (PPR) every time a
      player catches a ball the player gets a point. There are the reliable, 75
      yards per game on 6-8 receptions with maybe a touchdown here and there;
      basically the Jarvis Landry’s of the world. And then there are the the
      Odell Beckham’s, Antonio Browns of the world who record 100+ yards a game
      with a scope of anywhere from no touchdowns to a ridiculous amount.
      These are the creme de la creme, and should definitely be targeted in
      the first or second round of your draft; again, depending on your
      position. They key to a successful wide receiver in fantasy football is
      volume. There will always be the DeSean Jacksons of the world, the
      players who erupt with 180 yards with two touchdowns off of 3 receptions
      one game, then have 1 reception for 10 yards the next game. These are
      not the receivers ideal for starting for your roster. The consistently
      targeted in throughout the game and especially in the red zone (near
      the endzone) are the players that you should target. Similarly to
      running backs, there are two slots for receivers and you can flex
      (again, later). Carry at least three receivers.
    </p>
    <h3>Tight Ends</h3>
    <img src = "http://images.performgroup.com/di/library/sporting_news/8c/6b/rob-gronkowski-0122318-getty-ftr_pgjnb6nzxhxi1hcs8e7uw2q9o.jpg?t=612614161&w=960&quality=70" height= "100px"/>
    <p id="txt">
    The tight end position is never deep, as most passing attacks are
    facilitated through the wide receivers and running backs. However, the
    important trait of a premium tight end is how many touchdowns he scores.
    Since the position is never deep, it is okay (unless you are going for a
    star such as Travis Kelce, Rob Gronkowski, or Zach Ertz) to draft a good
    tight end for a lower ADP than to buy too high and miss out on another
    skill player. Carry only one tight end, and pick one off of the waiver
    wire when your starter is on bye.</p>
    <h3>Flex</h3>
    <p id="txt">
    The Flex, short for flexible, is named this for the reason that you can
    place a running back, wide receiver, or a tight end here (some platforms
    call it a W/R/T position). The flex is where you can get creative, as you
    can alternate between players that are in form and out of form, players
    that have good matchups with those who have poor matchups, and those who
    have the volatility to become fantasy league winners with busts. Indeed
    the flex is the most important unimportant position in fantasy, depending
    on who you put there. It can be the next Alvin Kamara or it could be
    Terrelle Pryor. The flex position is ideally suited for any of a manager’s
    needs.
    </p>
    <h3>D/ST</h3>
    <p id="txt">D/ST stands for Defense/Special Teams. Don’t
      overthink it. Draft one in the later rounds of your draft, and swap it
      out for another one during that team’s bye week. Although defenses can
      have monster games from time to time, it is incredibly hard to predict,
      and time and a high draft pick should not be wasted on trying to pick
      the best one available. Do not overthink it.</p>
    <h3>Kickers</h3>
    <p id="txt">
      Same as D/ST. Do not overthink it. Try to land a kicker on an offense
      with trouble in the red zone, because he will have many opportunities
      to score field goals. The last round is generally devoted to kickers.
      Again, draft only one and swap it out for another one during a bye week.
