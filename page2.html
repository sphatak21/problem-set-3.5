  <h3>Sleeper</h3>

    	A sleeper is a player that well outperforms his ADP, or average draft
    	position. The sleeper is the epitomy of what fantasy football is about:
    	the name of the game is to compile the lineup that has the greatest value
    	for the price paid. A sleeper last year could have been Tarik Cohen.
    	The Bears running back was virtually an unknown, as Jordan Howard had dominated
    	the backfield the year before. However, Cohen was used as a change of pace
    	back and allowed the fairly one demensional Bears offense to be a little
    	more versatile. Sleepers are difficult to predict, because there are several
    	different factors that can affect the potential work that a player gets.
    	For example, sleepers can be made because of circumstances such as suspension,
    	demonstrated by the emergence of wide reciever Juju Smith-Schuster of the
    	Pittsburgh Steelers. Smith-Schuster was called in after reciever Martavius Bryant
    	was reactivated aftesr a long suspension. Although Bryant was still available
    	much of the season, Smith-Schuster was able to solidify himself as the WR2 of
    	the Steelers (behind Antonio Brown) after a string of solid performances.

  <h3>Breakouts</h3>
  <p id = "info">
A breakout player is similar to a sleeper, but a sleeper that "breaks out"
tot the upper echelon of fantasy players. Predicting breakouts is even more
difficult than predicting a sleeper, because a player must surpass his ADP and
be a top 10, if not top 5 player. A player that demonstrated this last year
was rookie running back Kareem Hunt. After exploding in Week 1 versus
the New England Patriots, rushing for 148 yards and a touchdown and adding
98 recieving yards off of 5 catches, 2 of which were touchdowns, Hunt continued
his rampage by becoming the NFL leader in rushing that season. Rookies such as
Hunt are generally candidates to become elite players, especially if they are thrust
into a huge role because of an injury. A breakout player is generally also created
because of high volume. A breakout player must be able to sustain his success over
more than one game. This is the most important feature of a breakout player. He is
able to sustain his elite performances over the entire season, and eventually can
become a league winner for your team </p>

  <h3>Busts</h3>
  <p id = "info">
A bust is a player that comes into the season with high expectations but significantly
underperforms his ADP. This can happen for several reasons: the player can get injured, but still play,
only to have that injury linger and negatively impact his play. Busts can also be players that have tons
of talent but are may be limited by another player in his position, or just cannot get into the endzone
for his life. Out of every draft, it is critical to limit the number of busts that are on your team.
Busts are often high risk-high reward players. Terrele Pryor Sr. was an example of a bust. After being
a sleeper in the 2016 season for the abysmal Cleveland Browns, there were hopes that he would thrive as the
number one reciever on the Redskins, an offense that was primed for a big season with young and improving
quarterback Kirk Cousins under center. As it turned out, those who drafter Pryor were disappointed, as he was
terrible, and barely made the team by the end of the season.</p>
